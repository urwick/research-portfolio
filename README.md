# Research Portfolio

This repository contains selected examples of my applied research work in health and labor economics. 
The projects focus on large administrative and survey datasets, reproducible workflows, and policy-relevant analysis.

My research interests include:
- Labor supply and caregiving
- Disability and work capacity
- Health insurance and healthcare utilization
- Disparities in access to care

All projects emphasize transparent data cleaning, careful documentation, and interpretation of results.
